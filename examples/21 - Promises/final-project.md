# JavaScript + jQuery Final Project

The final project will call upon everything we have done so far. This is your time to shine and really push yourself — this project isn't just about showing what your have done so far, it's the biggest learning experience in the class so far. With JavaScript, most of your learning comes through application - just coding something that will challenge you. 


## Requirements 

The only requirement is that you challenge yourself. Since this class is JavaScript focused, you will probably want to do some sort of "app" that has functionality, logic and interaction.

### Apis

Find an API to work with and build an application that fetches and displays data. You can use an API we have worked with already or find another one on <http://apis.io/>

Some Ideas:

* Photo Gallery with a search functionality - hook into Flickr or the Rijks Museam. 
* Weather Application that changes the design of the page based on the time and weather
* HackerFood - find things to eat nearby

### Hardware

Using any of the hardware access we learned - webcam, microphone, geolocation etc - build an app that uses these in a fun/useful way.

### Video or Audio

Build an instrument that you can play. 

Build a full featured video or audio player that plays videos/music and allows you to control everything from switching the songs to the volume. Perhaps you could take a list of youtube links and build a playlist with thumbnails from that.

### Earlier Project

We have had lots of projects and exercises over the past few months - there may have been one that you wished you had tried but didn't have the time - now is an okay time to try that. For example the countdown timer or the invoice creator.
